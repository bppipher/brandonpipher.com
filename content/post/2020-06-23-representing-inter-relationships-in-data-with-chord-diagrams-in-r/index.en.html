<pre class="r"><code>library(circlize)
library(chorddiag)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>I’ve noticed Chord diagrams to be growing in popularity recently, and mostly by people utilizing Python. I’ve also noticed with Flourish’s API you can seemingly produce these Chord diagrams fairly easily, but you can skip outside software as these diagrams can be made with a few different packages in R.</p>
<p>The <code>circlize</code> is fairly straightforward, especially with its <a href="https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/">detailed documentation</a>, but I often prefer the interactivity other methods offer. Chord diagrams quickly produce too much information and being able to browse individual Chords goes a long way in producing an effective presentation. Another alternative is with <code>Plotly</code>, but it requires a fair amount of effort. I had also <a href="https://python-graph-gallery.com/chord-diagram/">recently learned</a> that <code>Bokeh</code> can also produce these.</p>
<p>For the showcase data I’ll stick with a Pokemon dataset that I’ve seen used for various visualizations. The dataset in question is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon">here</a>, but another equally interesting dataset is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon?select=pokemon.csv">here</a></p>
<p>The goal is to demonstrate the relationship (flow) between the primary and secondary type sets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(circlize)
library(chorddiag)
# The following libraries are used for
# quickly producing an adjacency matrix
library(igraph)
library(tidygraph)
# Quick cleaning of the data
# Removing Mega&#39;s and Forme duplications
pokemon &lt;- 
  pokemon_data %&gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(Name,&quot;Mega &quot;,
                    negate = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  filter(!duplicated(`#`))

# To quickly plot in Circlize you need
# to form the data into a frequency table
pokecount &lt;-
  pokemon %&gt;%
  count(`Type 1`,`Type 2`, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%
  mutate(`Type 2` = coalesce(`Type 2`,`Type 1`))

circlize::chordDiagram(pokecount)</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the above, I think the “too much information” approach is demonstrated fairly well.</p>
<p>However, I did find a package to accomplish this that I’ve become rather fond of: Enter <code>chorddiag</code>. The <code>chorddiag</code> package isn’t hosted on CRAN, but you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/mattflor/chorddiag">github here</a>. The gist of <code>chorddiag</code> is that it allows you to create interactive chord diagrams by way of the JavaScript visualization library D3 (<a href="http://d3js.org" class="uri">http://d3js.org</a>). It works from within R using the htmlwidgets interfacing framework.</p>
<p>To use the default before rather than a frequency table we need to produce an adjacency matrix. I did this the manual way at first:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokecount_mat &lt;- 
  pokecount %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = &#39;Type 2&#39;,
              values_from = n) %&gt;%
  replace(is.na(.),0)

pokecount_mat &lt;- 
  pokecount_mat[c(&quot;Type 1&quot;,pokecount_mat %&gt;% 
                                   select(&quot;Type 1&quot;) %&gt;%
                                   unique() %&gt;% 
                                   as.matrix %&gt;%
                                   as.character())]
pokecount_mat &lt;-
  pokecount_mat %&gt;%
  column_to_rownames(&quot;Type 1&quot;) %&gt;%
  as.matrix()


chorddiag::chorddiag(pokecount_mat)</code></pre>

<p>Though there is also a more automoted way using <code>igraph</code> and <code>tidygraph</code>:</p>

  tidygraph::as_tbl_graph() %&gt;%

<p>Talk about an efficient workflow! Comparing the two I think it becomes strikingly clear how much interactivity adds to this plot. Of course interactivity isn’t always feasible for every medium, and that is where working off of <code>circlize</code> would likely have a distinct advantage.</p>
